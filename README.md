This repository contains code used for calculating square roots for BigIntegers (System.Numerics.BigInteger).

Currently there is no method in the BigInteger Struct. Therefore this code snippet is Licenced under The Unlicense licence,
which permits free use of the software.

There are two methods that are used, both are a part of BigIntegerSqrt class, in BigIntegerSqrt Namespace. 

The file with the two methods is called BigIntegerSqrt.cs located in BigIntegerSqrt/BigIntegerSqrt.

The Program.cs file contains Main method, where you can see an example of how to use the BigIntegerSqrt.Sqrt method.
